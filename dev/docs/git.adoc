== rebase on top of new `main` branch commits

https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#Documentation/git-rebase.txt--Xstrategy-option

Accept all incoming changes from `main` branch: use the `-X` option with the `ours` strategy.
`-Xours` tells `git` to protect the new base. By bringing in only the additions that the incoming commits have made, it protects what is already in the new base.

[source, shell]
----
❯ git rebase -Xours origin/main
----

Then fix any conflicts and continue the rebase.
